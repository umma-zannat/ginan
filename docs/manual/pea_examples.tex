\chapter{PEA examples}
\label{ch:pea_examples}

In this section we go through a number of different ways that the pea can be used to process GNSS data.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Precise Point Positioning (PPP) processing - In this section we will demonstrate how to processing in PPP mode using the Ionosphere free combination, we will provide an example on how to use IGS products to obtian a float solution, and then an example on how to obtain an ambguity fixed solution. We will also cover how to process gnss streams in realtime.
	\item Obtain an orbit solution from a global tracking network
	\item Obtain an orbit and clock solution from a global tracking network
	\item How to process a Global solution in real-time
	\item How to obtain an ionosphere model 
\end{enumerate}
