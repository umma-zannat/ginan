\chapter{Docker}
\label{ch:docker}
\textit{Docker is} ``an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications''. It is a convenient way for us to provide all of the dependencies and the latest release source code so that we can use the ginan tool kit straight out of the box.
%
In order for this to work, we will first need to install the docker engine onto our local machine. If we are running a different operating system instructions on how to install docker can be found at \href{https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/}{docker desktop downlod link}, these also include alternative methods of installing on ubuntu and has links to recommended best practices.
%
To find more information on docker have a look at the \href{https://docs.docker.com/get-started/}{getting started guide} provided by docker.

\section{Ubuntu Docker dependency installation guide}
If we are running ubuntu, we can install a docker engine. A summary of the commands to download and install docker involve setting up the ubuntu repository system to link with the docker repsotory are given below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ sudo apt -y update
$ sudo apt -y install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
\end{lstlisting}

Add the dockers official GPG key:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
$ echo \
"deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
\end{lstlisting}
%
Then update the repository management system and install the packages.
%
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
\end{lstlisting}

Verify that the Docker engine is installed correctly by running the \emph{hello-world} image.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ docker run hello-world
\end{lstlisting}

Then we will need to include the current user to the \emph{docker} group:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ sudo usermod -aG docker root
$ sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
\end{lstlisting}
You will need to log out and back in for the permissions to take effect.

\section{Using Docker}

Once we have docker installed on our local machine we will need to download our image for Ginan:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ docker pull gnssanalysis/ginan:latest
\end{lstlisting}
Then we can run the image as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ docker run -it -v /data:/data gnssanalysis/ginan:latest bash
\end{lstlisting}
This gives us a run-time environment where Ginan is installed with the executables
\emph{pea} and \emph{pod} already in your path.
Here, the \emph{-v} option mounts a volume inside the docker instance at \emph{/data},
which maps to the \emph{/data} folder of the host machine. This way this folder
can be shared between the host and the container, and the results can persist.

You should now see a \emph{bash} prompt running inside the docker container.
You can check the availability of Ginan executables by running
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ pea --help
$ pod --help
\end{lstlisting}

To run some tests, try:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ /ginan/docker/run-tests-pea.sh 1   # this is the test number to run, from 1 to 8 currently
$ /ginan/docker/run-tests-pod.sh 1   # this is the test number to run, from 1 to 6 currently
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, to exit this session, type:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ exit
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Keeping a container running}
If we instantiate a container this way, our session will finish when we quit the \emph{bash} prompt.
The changes we make to the container will also be lost, except the changes that persist outside
of the container, that is, the \emph{/data} folder in our example.

Therefore, it is sometimes useful to keep a container running, and connect to it and detach
from it as needed.

To start up a docker container in the detached mode, run:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ docker run -d -v /data:/data gnssanalysis/ginan:latest sleep infinity
\end{lstlisting}
we can verify that the container is running in the background:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ docker ps
\end{lstlisting}
This will show a container ID. Docker conveniently also provides an alias as a ``name``.
We can start a new bash shell inside the container by:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ docker exec -it <name> bash
\end{lstlisting}
where \emph{<name>} is the name or ID of the running docker container.
